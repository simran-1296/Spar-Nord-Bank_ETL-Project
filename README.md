# Spar-Nord-Bank_ETL-Project
The project task was to build a batch ETL pipeline; to ingest a dimensional model datastore (ATM Data Mart) data from RDS, transform it using Spark and then load it into AWS Redshift Tables, after which I had to perform analytical queries, on the loaded data, to answer business questions.
