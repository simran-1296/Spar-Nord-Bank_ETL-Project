# Spar-Nord-Bank_ETL-Project
The project task was to build a batch ETL pipeline - 
To ingest a dimensional model datastore (ATM Data Mart) from RDS into HDFS (using AWS EC2), 
To transform the data using Spark (using AWS EC2) to create relevant dimension and fact tables, 
To upload these tables into AWS S3 buckets, and finally load them from S3 into AWS Redshift tables;
Lastly, I performed analytical queries on the loaded data, to answer business questions.
